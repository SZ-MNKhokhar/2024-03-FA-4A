Consider a language defined over âˆ‘={a,b} that accepts the strings starting with a and ending in b. Write a C++ program that stays in an infinite loop, prompts the user for a string, terminates if the string is QUIT, and otherwise implements the DFA using the scheme that allows state to state function-call and recursion.
